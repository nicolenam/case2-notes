# Chace Building Supply Website Optimization

This repository contains the analysis, proposed optimizations, and updated code for the Chace Building Supply website optimization project. The goal of this project is to improve the website's performance, semantic structure, and search engine optimization (SEO) while adhering to the TOOLBX design standards.

## Analysis

The existing Chace Building Supply website has been neglected for years, resulting in slow page load times and a lack of proper semantic structure. To address these issues, the following optimizations have been identified:

1. **Page Load Time Optimization**: The website's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code will be optimized to reduce page load time. Techniques such as minification, compression, and efficient use of browser caching will be employed.

2. **Semantic Structure Enhancement**: The website's markup will be enhanced to adhere to semantic HTML practices. Proper usage of HTML5 structural elements like header, nav, main, and footer will be implemented to improve readability and accessibility.

3. **SEO Optimization**: The current markup will be evaluated for SEO deficiencies and improvements will be made. This includes using appropriate heading tags, meta tags, and structured data markup to enhance the website's visibility in search engine rankings.

## Proposed Optimizations

Based on the analysis, the following optimizations will be implemented:

1. Minification and Compression: The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code will be minified to reduce file size and improve load times. Additionally, server-side compression techniques such as Gzip will be applied to further optimize file transfer.

2. Browser Caching: The website's static assets, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files, will be configured with appropriate cache headers to allow browsers to cache them and reduce the need for repeated downloads.

3. Semantic HTML Structure: The existing markup will be updated to utilize semantic HTML5 elements, improving the website's structure and making it more accessible to users and search engines.

4. SEO Enhancements: Relevant heading tags (h1, h2, etc.) will be utilized to provide a clear hierarchy of content. Meta tags, including title, description, and keywords, will be optimized to accurately represent each page's content. Structured data markup will be added where appropriate to provide search engines with additional context.

## Updated Code

The updated code will reflect the optimizations mentioned above. 

- **index.html**: Updated HTML markup with semantic structure and optimized meta tags.
- **styles.css**: Minified and optimized CSS code with improved class naming and structure.
- **main.js**: Minified and optimized JavaScript code with improved performance and reduced dependencies.

Note: The provided code represents a representative sample of the website's pages. Additional pages can be updated in a similar manner.
